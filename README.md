### Overview
This is a landing webpage of a restaurant website which includes elements i.e. images, buttons, links etc. To make this webpage, HTML, CSS and little JavaScript is used. This project mainly focuses on implementation of header, section, div, img, ul, li, forms, footer tag of HTML and CSS layout and responsive web design elements. 

Website is divided into header, section and footer. There are some active elements over which hover properties is defined.

### The challenge
a. Making a fully responsive webpage for all the screen sizes.

b. Smooth scrolling of webpage.

c. Designing Hamburgur menu.

d. Designing CSS overlays.

### Project description
a. I chose this project as I have to put my layout skills to test with this HTML & CSS landing page challenge. This project includes a design for hover states and overlays. This project also solves the problem of responsiveness of website on mobile as well as desktop. 

The CSS flexbox is useful for designing websites, and with the help of that we can easily divide the whole body of the webpage into different sub segments and also we can overlap one segment upon another as desired.

Media query is used to make webpage responsive by adding a breakpoint according to different screen sizes. It is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

b. I have used HTML, CSS and a little JS to build this website.

c. I have implemented some of the featues including;-
   - making website responsive on multiple device screens and CSS media queries has been used for that.
   - Design of the website layouts and overlays using CSS flexbox.
   - Design of a hamburger menu using HTML and CSS.

### My process

- In html at first I wrote different sections including header, sections and footer. In sections I have included different elements of the webpage one after the other. Some sections include image as well.  

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  
<head>
  
  
</head>

<body>
  
  <header>
    
    
  </header>

  <section>
    
  </section>
   

  
  <section>
    
  </section>

  <footer>
    
  </footer>
 
</body>
  
</html>

- Then in the stylesheet the background and the page layout structures are set using background and color padding and margin properties.
 
- CSS properties I have used are width, margin, padding, display, media queries, css animation, transition, transform, hover, color, background, align, border etc.


### Built with


- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

- Media queries for responsiveness

### What I learned

I have learnt the best practice to write html code using header, section, and footer, use of span tag etc.  

In CSS, I learnt mostly to build a perfect layout using css flexbox, css animation, box-sizing property, use of margin and padding to align html elements and use of media queries to make page responsive.

### Continued development

- CSS flexbox is layout module, I will definitely learn it better by applying it in more projects.

- Media queries and animations was something new to implement, i am gonna use it in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp) - This helped me for implementation of css flexbox, padding, margin, width and box-sizing concept. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.


- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand media queries impelmentation to provide responsiveness for different screens. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
